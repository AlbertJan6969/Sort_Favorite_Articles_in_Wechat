# Tool_to_Sort_Favorite_Articles
this tool designs to sort favorite files or articles on WeChat(a Chinese app)
Here I don't need to further list disadvantages of WeChat. It is a really bad app. Limited size of transfering files, relying on your phone to log in... the list goes on. Sometime, people have to install other third-party exe. or app. to make it barely usuable. 
These scripts help you to sort articles in WeChat. Print out a list of URL and name of articles directly within a few seconds. 
I recommend you to sort out articles frequently. 
Otherwise, after for a period, you can't find any articles you want in the default directory in Wechat. 



Version1: using command in Windows to open the file so that we can paste texts by pressing Ctrl V
Version2: output txt form, don't need to copy texts from the console
Version3: a hub of settings of user preference (coming soon, refining code right now)
